Many jailbreak only because they need ultrasn0w  to unlock their iPhone. They have no interest in the apps found in Cydia, the majority of which are of poor quality. Furthermore Cydia installs many dependencies, including an entire UNIX subset. I find Cydia ugly, buggy, and slow.  Using it feels like an unpolished Linux distribution more than the pretty and usable iPhone OS version of Mac OS X. Personally, I experienced instability just with Cydia installed by itself. Additionally, Cydia encourages installation of poor quality themes and apps that will most likely result in the need to restore.
 
If you are one who just wants his mobile unlocked without  unnecessary fluff, CreamSn0w is for you. It takes advantage of the custom packages feature of PwnageTool. Select 'creamsn0w' in PwnageTool, and you will have a firmware ready for use at  first boot. There will be no more hunting for Cydia packages to make your iPhone usable.
 
Cydia will not be installed. No visible modifications can be seen. The iPhone will behave like an official unlocked phone even though it is not. It is safe to take it into the Apple store. Their employees will not be able to detect that it is jailbroken and unlocked from just looking at it. Just do not let them restore it. You will not lose your warranty. I thank the iPhone Dev Team for creating PwnageTool and ultrasn0w. I also thank Saurik for Mobile Substrate.
 
CreamSn0w will always use the latest Mobile Substrate  and ultrasn0w available at the time of release. Unfortunately, it is Mac only; there is currently no Windows solution. But, a firmware created with PwnageTool on Mac can and should be shared.

There is one caveat though. iTunes was changed recently to detect ultrasn0w. It is refusing to activate by showing the image bellow. The workaround is to check the "Activate the phone" option in PwnageTool which will hacktivate the iPhone bypassing the iTunes check. If you are currently jailbroken, you could backup your official activation and create an CreamSn0w addon containing it. Either method will give you a firmware which will work on first boot without having to hunt for unlocks and patches.
