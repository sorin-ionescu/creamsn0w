Description
--------------------------------------------------------------
Many jailbreak only because they need ultrasn0w or blacksn0w 
to unlock their mobile. They have no interest in the apps
found in Cydia, the majority of which are of poor quality.
Furthermore Cydia installs many dependencies, including an
entire UNIX subset. I find Cydia ugly, buggy, and slow. 
Using it feels like an unpolished Linux distribution more
than the pretty and usable iPhone OS version of Mac OS X.
Personally, I have experienced instability just with Cydia
installed by itself. Additionally, Cydia encourages
installation of said poor quality themes and apps that will
most likely result in the need to restore.

The alternative to Cydia is Icy. It is a newcomer and,
currently, it is quite buggy. Additionally the Icy bundle in
PwnageTool is broken. It is universaly hated by the Cydia
crowd and it seems that the Dev Team have not paid much
attention to Icy because it is missing a lot of the UNIX
subset required for complicated packages. Meaning, packages
will not install, or if they do install, they will not work
properly, or not at all.

If you are one who just wants his mobile unlocked without 
unnecessary fluff, creamsn0w is for you. It takes advantage
of the custom packages feature of PwnageTool. Select creamsn0w
in PwnageTool, and you will have a firmware ready for use at
first boot. There will be no more hunting for Cydia packages
to make your iPhone usable.

Cydia and Icy will not be installed. No visible modifications
can be seen. The iPhone will behave like an official unlocked
phone even though it is not. It is safe to take it into the
Apple store. Their employees will not be able to detect that
it is jailbroken and unlocked from just looking at it.
Just do not let them restore it. You will not lose your
warranty.

Updates will be posted at http://spookyet.posterous.com
