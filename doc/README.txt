Description
--------------------------------------------------------------
Many jailbreak only to unlock their iPhone with no interest
in the applications found in Cydia, the majority of which are
of poor quality. Furthermore, Cydia installs many
dependencies, including an entire UNIX subset. I find Cydia
ugly, buggy, and slow. Using it feels like an unpolished
Linux distribution more than the pretty and usable iOS.
Personally, I experienced instability just with Cydia
installed by itself. Additionally, Cydia encourages
installation of poor quality themes and apps that will most
likely result in the need to restore.
 
If you are one who just wants his iPhone unlocked without
unnecessary fluff, CreamSn0w is for you. It takes advantage
of the custom packages feature of PwnageTool. Select
'creamsn0w' in PwnageTool, and you will have a firmware ready
for use at first boot. There will be no more hunting for
Cydia packages to make your iPhone usable.
 
Cydia will not be installed. No visible modifications can be
seen. The iPhone will behave like an official unlocked phone,
even though it is not. It is safe to take it into the Apple
store. Their employees will not be able to detect that it is
jailbroken and unlocked by just looking at it. Just do not
let them restore it. You will not lose your warranty.
 
CreamSn0w will always use the latest available firmware
patches at the time of release. Unfortunately, it is Mac
only; there is currently no Windows solution, but a firmware
created with PwnageTool on Mac can and should be shared.
 
Updates will be posted at
